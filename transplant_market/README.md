# Module Architecture

- `agent.py`: Defines an `Agent` as a buyer or seller with (1) characteristics that affect post-transplant outcomes and (2) economic characteristics that affect market behavior. Datasets: OPTN, NHIS, Census
  - Analyzes the OPTN and census data for summary statistics and representativeness of general population.
  - Draws on OPTN and census data for methods that draw agents from the patient and general populations.
  - Provides methods to estimate projected utility over time conditioned on either getting or giving a kidney based on a composite model from existing research.
    - Immediate mortality: Probability of death directly due to surgery
    - Long-term mortality: Age, race, income, wealth, time on dialysis, diabetes, had prior solid organ transplant
    - Immediate costs: Lost wages, transportation costs, medical costs, insurance
    - Long-term costs: Long-term medical costs due to increased risk of kidney failure
    - Income over time: Age, race, income, wealth, changes in physical capacity to work, social stigma
- `run_simulation.py`: Runs simulations of the market based on adjustible environmental parameters, using `Agent`s generated by `agent.py`. Measures outcomes into a pandas dataframe that can then be analyzed.
